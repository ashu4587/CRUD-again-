            <h1> Your Iphone as your Key</h1>
            <p>In cooperation with Apple, BMW is the first car maker in the world to offer customers a digital car key on their iPhone. In the future, you will be able to set up a car key on a compatible iPhone and share it with up to five friends. Here’s how the BMW Digital Key works.</p>

            <h1> Let you Explore Our New Features</h1>
            <p>If both your iPhone and your car are compatible, you can set up a Digital Key. If your BMW is not already linked to a BMW ID, use the My BMW App to add it to an existing BMW ID or to create a new BMW ID. First, create a BMW ID and use the My BMW App to add your vehicle. To begin the setup process, access the Digital Key menu in the app. For security reasons, you must be sitting in your car and have both of your regular car keys with you in order to prove that you are the owner. 

              Press the Start Pairing button, follow the instructions in the My BMW App menu, and place your iPhone in the smartphone tray with the NFC sensor, and you’re done! Your Digital Key will then be stored in the Apple Wallet app.
